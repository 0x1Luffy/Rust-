## Borrowing in Rust 

 - Borrowing in rust is like lending the varible for some time 
   to another variable.
 - No ownership transfer happens while Borrowing.
 # If a varibable is borrowed, the the one who is Borrowing 
   cannot make changes in it. (Unless Specifeied explicitly)
 - We can borrow a variable in two ways: 
    # immutable and 
    # mutable.
 
 # Syntax for simple Borrowing

   - just adding '&'.

# Mutable Borrowing
  - To borrow and make changes into that requires 
    permission from the owner of that varibable.
  - The owner have to explicitly give right to make changes 
    
     # he can Specify it by adding (&mut)
