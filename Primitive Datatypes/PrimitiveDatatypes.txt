 -There are majorly 4 Datatypes in Rust 
   -Integer
   -Float
   -Bool
   -Char

##Integer 
  
  # Rust has 
    - signed (+ and -)
    - unsigned (Holds only Positive Intergers, has different sizes)

 #Signed Interger

 i8, i16, i32, i64, i128

##Unsigned Integer

 u8, u16, u32, u64, u128


##Floats
 -Only two types of floating points

   f32, f64

## Booleans 

 - True 
 - False

## Character

 - It represents single Unicode Scalar Value 
 - eg : a,b,c,d,x,y,z
