How Rust Works or Rust Syntax

 - Just like c or C++ rust starts with the main function so we need to define a main function first 
  
     fn main ()
    {
       println!("hello World');
      
       }


  - to print something in rust we use println!

  - To run the rust file or program the following steps are done

     -Type rustc name of the program 
      - eg: rustc hello.rs 

  - Rust builds a .exe file for that.

## Important Note 

  - Everytime you make a change in the code you have to comile that whole code again 
    if not done the privous compiled state output will be displayed.

 - So to avoid this step every time we use cargo package to create a project.
