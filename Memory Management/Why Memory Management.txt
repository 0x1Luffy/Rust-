## Why Memory Management required?

 - in C and C++ Language when we create Memory 
 and we use pointers to use and assign value to the Memory.
 - So after the Memory usage is done we free that Memory
   but still that pointer which was pointing towards that block
   of Memory is accessiable and now that pointer contains a garbage value.

 - This phenomium is known as dangling pointer.

 ## Stack vs Heap 

  ## Stack 

   - Static memory allocation 
   - Compiler already knows about the requirement
   - ummutable in nature.

 ## Heap

   - Dynamic memory allocation
   - mutable in nature
   - ownership concept are mostly applied on heap memory
   - memory is allocated at runtime
