## Ownership In Rust 

 - Ownership is Rust's most unique feature, and it enables Rust 
   to make memeory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.


## OWNERSHIP RULES (Most Important) 

  ## Rule 1:
     - Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.

  ## Rule 2:
     - There can be only one "Owner" at a time.

  ## Rule 3:
     - When the Owner goes out of the scope, the value will be dropped.
