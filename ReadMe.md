# Learning Rust

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This repo documents my journey as I learn the Rust programming language. Here, you'll find my notes, code snippets, projects, and any other materials that have helped me understand Rust better.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my learnings and experiments with the Rust programming language. Rust is known for its safety, speed, and concurrency, making it an excellent choice for system-level programming.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Rust, here's how you can get started:

1. **Install Rust**: Follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust.
2. **Set up your development environment**: You'll need a code editor. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Rust extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust).

## Learning Resources

Here are some of the resources I've found helpful:

- [Web3 Cohort - By Harkirat Singh](https://harkirat.classx.co.in/new-courses/13-complete-web3-blockchain-cohort)


## Code Examples

In the `examples` directory, you'll find various code snippets and small programs that I've written while learning Rust. Each example is self-contained and has comments explaining the code.

## Projects

As I progress, I'll work on larger projects to apply what I've learned. These projects can be found in the `projects` directory. Each project has its own README file with detailed information.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository, feel free to fork it, make your changes, and submit a pull request. I'm open to suggestions, improvements, and corrections.
