## Referencing Rules

 - While taking reference or borrowing the value 
   you should always keep somethings in consideration

 # If you taking or borrowing a variable then use it only single time
   or only within that phase.

   eg: let mut s1:String = String::from("Hello");
        let s2:String = &mut s1;
        println!("{}", s2);

    now in the above code i have reffered the s1 and keep it into s2
    and i am using it right away.

    - But if i use it again later in the code it will throw an error
    - as when you use any reffered value and "Again when you crerate a new reffered variable"
      then the old one is killed there.

 ## Read and Write Synchronization

  - While reading and writing into a variable it should be Synchronized.
