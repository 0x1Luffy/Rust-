## Expressions and Statements 

 ##Expressions 

  - anything that returns a value
  - eg: 5, true false, add(3,4), if conditions, else conditions

 ##Statements
   
  - anything that does not return a value
  - almost all Statements in rust ends with ;
  eg: let x:i32 = 4;
     varibable declarations are considered as Statements

## Important Note 

  # In Rust if you want to declare variable globally 
   i.e outside the main function then you have to 
   " Declare it using const  " and " Upper snake case (_X) "

## Expression Syntax

  let x: (datatype) = {
    anything
  }
