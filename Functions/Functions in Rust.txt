## Functions in Rust 

 - Functions and their varibable name should always be 
   written in snake_case 
    -  eg: fn my_function()
        {

            }

- In Rust functions are Hoisted 

## Functions with arguments 

 eg: fn my_height(heght: u32)
 {
    println!("Height is : {}", heght);
 } 


## Functions Returning Value 
  
  - The functions that Return values have an 
   different writing and calling style/syntax

   #syntax 
     - fn add(a:i8 , b:i32) -> i32 
     {
        a + b
     }

     in above function the arrow dipects that the functions
     is supposed to return something 
     - The return type should also be specified (->i32)
