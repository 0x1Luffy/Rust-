## Dereferencing & AutoDereferencing


# Dereferencing 
  - Accessing the value that a reference points to.
    Syntax: Use the * symbol to dereference a reference.

    eg:     let x = 5;
            let y = &x;  // y is a reference to x
            let z = *y; // z is the value that y points to, which is 5

# AutoDereferencing 
   - Rust can automatically dereference references in certain contexts,
    simplifying code by eliminating the need for explicit dereferencing 
    with the * operator.


## Important Note: 
    - Sometimes you have to explicitly derefer the values.
    - And Sometimes AutoDereferencing Works.
